## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
### Introduction

This repository contains my assignment for the course project for "Getting and Cleaning data" part of the Data Science specialization from Coursera. 

1.  run_analysis.R
2.  tidydataset.txt
3.  CodeBook.md
4.  README.md

### R Language Program
The program ‘run_analysis.R’ reads from set of downloaded data files recorded from an experiment using 
the database of 30 people in training or test mode using the results of the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern, ‘-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The program performs the process to extract and clean the data from a set of raw data files identified in the CookBook. A clean and tidy dataset (tidydataset.txt) is produced as an output to allow for further analysis.

### The Cookbook

The CodeBook.md file explains how the transformations are performed and the variables used and the resulting data.
